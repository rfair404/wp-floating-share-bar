# WhatsApp issue tracking

Okay, you're going to report an issue:

1. Take a look at the [FAQs](https://github.com/kriskbx/whatsapp-sharing#faq) first - maybe there's something that solves your issue.
2. Take a look at the [issues](https://github.com/kriskbx/whatsapp-sharing/issues) already reported and +1 if you're experiencing the same problem.
3. Open your Browsers JavaScript console on your website and type `WASHAREBTN`. If you see something like this `WASHAREBTN is not defined` the library is not loaded. Repeat the installation steps!
4. Provide an example: this can be a link to your website or a jsfiddle. We can't help you without code we can take a look at.
5. Happy reporting.
