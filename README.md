# Russell's Toptal Project Plugin (a.k.a. levitating social sharing buttons)

The goal is to create a plugin that will automatically display selected social network(s) sharing buttons in posts and/or on pages.

Support for the following social networks is required: Facebook, Twitter, Google+, Pinterest, LinkedIn, Whatsapp (for mobile browsers only).

The plugin options page must include the following configurable items:
*The choice to display on posts / pages / other registered custom post types
*Options to activate / deactivate the buttons for different social networks
*Three different button sizes to choose from (small / medium / large)
*The choice to display the icons in their original colors (default) or all in a selected color
*An option to determine in which order the icons will appear (e.g: FB - TW - G+ - etc)
*Options to place the social share bar (one or more of these can be selected)
*below the post title
*floating on the left area
*after the post content
*inside the featured image

The plugin should also enable a shortcode to include the sharing bar inside a post content
